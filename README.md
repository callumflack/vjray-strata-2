# vjray-strata-2

This is a working attempt to setup a design system using Next.js + styled-components + Rebass.

The example: https://vj-ray-client-fndebaotbf.now.sh/

In the original VJ Ray Strata project, we couldn't import the 'styled-system' library *and* have the styles render on deployment. Seems this rebuild works, albeit on a small use case.

To run locally: $ npm i

â€¦then $ npm run dev
