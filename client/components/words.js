Way back in 1962, in a one-room office in Campsie, V J Ray started its journey in the Sydney real estate scene.

Today, over 55 years later, our Strata Team has 27 staff, all with just one goal, to help people.

V J Ray is a family company that was started by Leon Pollard and is currently owned and operated by his son Mike Pollard.
The guiding principal behind the V J Ray culture has been to maintain the original family company atmosphere that is so often lost as companies grow into corporate giants.

At V J Ray we know that our job is much more that just looking after buildings, its about caring for and helping the people that own or live in those buildings. Its the people that matter.

That's why our mission statement is so simple.

We Help People.`
